# SYNC AGENT

SYNC AGENT is an expert data science assistant designed to help users manage and collaborate on data science projects. It leverages advanced LLMs and a set of modular tools to streamline workflows, manage version control, and interact with local and remote resources.

## Features

- **Conversational Data Science Assistant**: Collaborate with an AI agent to incrementally build, analyze, and model data projects.
- **Project Management**: Create, initialize, and manage projects with a standardized structure.
- **Dataflow Tools**: Load, query, and manipulate data within project directories.
- **Filesystem Access**: Securely interact with files in the designated working directory.
- **Version Control**: Integrated git and GitHub tools for clean, atomic commits and remote repository management.
- **Extensible Tooling**: Easily add or bind new tools for custom workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- API keys for OpenAI, GitHub, Supabase, etc. (see `.env`)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory.
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Configure environment variables** in `.env` (see sample keys in the provided file).
4. **Run the agent client**:
    ```sh
    python mcp_client.py
    ```

### Usage

- Interact with SYNC AGENT via the command line.
- Use the provided tools to load data, create projects, and manage files.
- All project changes are tracked with git for reproducibility.

## Project Philosophy

- **Atomic Commits**: Each change should be a logical, self-contained commit.
- **Reproducibility**: All data and code changes are versioned and auditable.
- **Security**: Filesystem access is restricted to the working directory.

## Extending

- Add new tools in `src/mcp_tools/local_servers/`.
- Update `src/mcp_tools/mcp_config.json` to register new tool servers.
